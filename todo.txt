        lesson finish modal

FEATURES

REFACTOR
    -- Blade-UI icons should be switched due to unchangable(?) HTML titles
    -- UI simple project, unification of notifications and language, should it be polish or english or both?
    -- categories index could(?) bo rewrited to livewire since it loads a ton of views, with
    makes app slow, almost 1000ms of load (but only localy ???)

TESTING

FUTURE / OPTIONAL
    -- audio
    -- models naming convencion change into languages name (?)
    -- success failure modals improvements
    -- design improvements, animations

OUTSIDE PROBLEMS
    -- better google indexing
    -- emails server


IN CONSIDERATION
    -- separate writing component
    -- "delete.blade" livewire views are typicaly same except item name, could be maybe merged into one view
    -- flashes
    -- additional validation of subcategories and categories unique combination
    -- blog
