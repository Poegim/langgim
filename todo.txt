BUGS
    -- checking is lesson learned loads in wrong order somewhere, u need to finish one more word to see
        lesson finish modal (???)

FEATURES
    -- quiz mode
    -- search engine in words index

REFACTOR
    -- models naming convencion change into languages name, to avoid switches

    -- categories index could(?) bo rewrited to livewire since it loads a ton of views,
    however it doesnt impact loads time on dev env

    -- rewrite engine to be client side,
       probably would be better to just rewrite whole Writing as new than updates.
