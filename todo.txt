FEATURES
    -- user profiles and personal settings
    -- contact form

REFACTOR
    -- Blade-UI icons should be switched due to unchangable(?) HTML titles
    -- UI simple project, unification of notifications and language, should it be polish or english or both?
    -- createOrUpdate to firstorcreate?
    -- categories index should bo rewrited to livewire since it loads a ton of views, with
    makes app slow, almost 1000ms of load

TESTING

IN CONSIDERATION
    -- separate writing component
    -- "delete.blade" livewire views are typicaly same except item name, could be merged into one view
    -- flashes
    -- additional validation of subcategories and categories unique combination
    -- blog
